## How can I edit this code?

There are several ways of editing your application.

**Use Lovable**

Simply visit the [Lovable Project](https://lovable.dev/projects/c51e2f24-5158-4bb0-bbb7-52860d96b318) and start prompting.

Changes made via Lovable will be committed automatically to this repo.

**Use your preferred IDE**

If you want to work locally using your own IDE, you can clone this repo and push changes. Pushed changes will also be reflected in Lovable.

The only requirement is having Node.js & npm installed - [install with nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)

Follow these steps:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```

**Edit a file directly in GitHub**

- Navigate to the desired file(s).
- Click the "Edit" button (pencil icon) at the top right of the file view.
- Make your changes and commit the changes.

**Use GitHub Codespaces**

- Navigate to the main page of your repository.
- Click on the "Code" button (green button) near the top right.
- Select the "Codespaces" tab.
- Click on "New codespace" to launch a new Codespace environment.
- Edit files directly within the Codespace and commit and push your changes once you're done.

## What technologies are used for this project?

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS

## Form submissions on `wild-ai-condensed-preview`

Sponsor, speaker/demo, email signup, Show & Tell, and chapter applications POST `/api/lead` only. The server writes private JSON with `put(..., { access: 'private' })` into the existing Vercel Blob store `wild-ai-leads` at `leads/<form>/<timestamp>-<suffix>.json`. The response is `{ ok: true, id: pathname }` and does not include a blob URL. `GET /api/lead` returns 405 and no submissions.

Email is not sent. There are no Resend or Postmark keys. Forms do not upload headshots. A social link on those forms is a LinkedIn or X URL only. `/admin` and `/admin/*` redirect to `/`.

`BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is already set on **wild-ai-condensed-preview** and is server-side only. It is not a `VITE_` variable and is not sent to the browser.

Jake reads submissions while signed in to the Vercel dashboard: **wild-ai-condensed-preview** → Storage → Blob → **wild-ai-leads**. A server process that has that environment variable can read the same private objects. Unauthenticated requests cannot list or fetch them.
